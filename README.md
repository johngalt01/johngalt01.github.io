This project is ment to work with THE LINKS,LINKS2,ELINKS Text browser,
In conjuction with the FABGL VGA32 ANSI Color Terminal.

https://github.com/johngalt01/johngalt01.github.io/blob/main/DSCN5986.JPG

You will have to setup one of the browsers above, I recommend ELINKS, on a Raspberry PI.

set terminal to max resolution 512x384,64 colors

set your telnet terminal 
LINES to 45-48
and 
COLUMNS to 80-83 
depending on your monitor.

When using any of the browsers above know they are extremely buggy
they can crash and start to generate a tmp file that will fill your
harddrive until system crash. I would isolate things.
 
for Elinks
i would setup a alias
alias elinks="elinks -no-connect -touch-files 1"

DO NOT use the bookmarks function in these browsers as it tends to make them go crazy.

here is my elinks.conf file which setups up the file associations.
you can use cat to output to the serial terminal
or use a small shell program:

#!/bin/bash
echo "$(<$1)"

that will pipe to the stdout.

the configuration file below sets the browser to automatically download and run cat which will send the escape codes to your terminal
i named the escape character files BMP because Elinks got confused with using VT file extensions.


python script settings can be edited from within ELINKS to customize how to display the image.

Automatic mode "python jpgtofabgl %f A N 0 0 100 2"

works best, Semi Automatic mode tends to crash the ELINKS browser as it does not like an 
external keypress to tell the script what to do.

## ELinks 0.17.GIT configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option.
